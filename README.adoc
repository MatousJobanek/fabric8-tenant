== Service for initializing and updating the tenant services in fabric8/openshift.io

The YAML for the tenant services is defined in the following projects:

* che : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-che
* jenkins : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-jenkins
* team : https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant-team

=== Testing YAML

When a PR is made on one of the above YAML repos you can test in production in your tenant via the following:

* http://openshift.io/ and login
* go to your Profile page (click the top right drop down and select `Profile`)
* add `/_tenant` to your browsers address bar - so you will be looking at a URL like https://openshift.io/my-user-name/_tenant
* enter the `sha` of the latest commit in your PR as a templates repository blob
* click `Update Profile`
* now https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-update-my-tenant-[Update Tenant] - you're tenant should now be running the PR

To go back to using the default YAML:

* go back to your tenant page like https://openshift.io/my-user-name/_tenant
* click `Clear Values`
* click `Update Profile`
* now https://github.com/openshiftio/openshift.io/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-update-my-tenant-[Update Tenant] and you should be back to the default versions

=== Development

==== Prerequisites

* git
* make
* go (tested with go 1.10.2)

==== How to build

Get the project:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant
```
Build the project:
```
$ make
```

==== Run unit tests


Clean and generate objects (to have the latest version of the generated files in case of any changes since the last run):
```
$ make clean && make generate
```

Check any dependency changes:
```
$ make deps
```

Run tests (without code coverage):
```
$ make test-unit-no-coverage
```

==== Run integration tests

You can do the same clean, generate and fetch the dependencies as it is suggested for unit tests:
```
$ make clean && make generate && make deps
```

Integration tests need to have a DB running. To use that we need to use a docker image for the build. For now just start it:
```
$ make docker-start
```

And start the DB:
```
$ make integration-test-env-prepare
```

Run all integration tests inside of the docker container (without code coverage):
```
$ make docker-test-migration && make docker-test-integration-no-coverage && make docker-test-remote-no-coverage
```

To stop containers:
```
$ make integration-test-env-tear-down
$ make docker-rm
```

==== Code formatting

To check if the code is properly formatted run:
```
$ make check-go-format
```

To format the code:
```
$ make format-go-code
```
